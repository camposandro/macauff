0.1.2 (unreleased)
----------------

General
^^^^^^^

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added functionality to convert .csv files to internal files used in the
  matching process, and create output .csv files from the resulting merged
  datasets created as a result of the matching. [#34]

- Added option to include the full perturbation AUF component, based on
  simulated Galactic source modelling. [#27]

- Added options to photometric routines to create full photometry-based
  likelihood and prior, or just use the photometric prior and use the naive
  equal-probability likelihood. [#25]

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Fix to issue with np.where test in ``test_counterpart_pairing`` causing incorrect
  failure to match probabilities. [#36]

- Fixes to various minor typos in variables in the cross-match workflow. [#32]

- Allow for the non-existence of a TRILEGAL simulation in any folder, and download
  new files even if ``tri_download_flag`` was set to ``False``. [#32]

- Save local normalising densities to file if ``compute_local_density`` was set
  to ``True``, to allow for its non-calculation in the future. [#32]

- Overload ``compute_local_density`` if it is set to ``False`` and the file
  storing local densities does not exist. [#32]

- ``create_single_perturb_auf`` corrected to run on a single filter, as its input
  intended, instead of looping through all filters. [#32]

- Removed final right-hand bin from consideration when identifying which magnitude
  bin each source should be assigned to in ``create_c_and_f``, to avoid an issue
  where sources of exactly the last bin are assigned outside the allowed range
  of indices. [#32]

- Fixed inefficiencies in both group sources and perturbation AUF creation runtime,
  significantly improving the speed of those parts of a cross-match. [#31]

- Corrected an error in ``tests.generate_random_data``, where only one catalogue
  had its source uncertainties simulated. [#23]

API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

- Moved several functions (``_load_single_sky_slice``, ``_load_rectangular_slice``,
  ``_lon_cut``, ``_lat_cut``) out of individual Python scripts into
  ``misc_functions`` to generalise their use in the codebase. [#27]

- Removed ``norm_scale_laws`` as an input to catalogue configuration files. [#27]

- Added ``dens_mags``, ``num_trials``, ``dm_max``, ``d_mag``, and
  ``compute_local_density`` as inputs to the joint and catalogue-specific
  configuration files [#27]

- Added ``int_fracs`` as an input to the joint configuration file for a
  cross-match. [#25]

Other Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Updates to documentation to reflect the relaxing of photometric likelihood and
  perturbation AUF component options. Other minor changes to documentation
  layout. [#30]

- GitHub Actions will only run remote data dependent tests (those marked with
  ``pytest.mark.remote_data``) on a pull request merge. [#27]

- Added ``astropy`` as a dependency. [#27]



0.1.1 (2021-01-06)
----------------

General
^^^^^^^

- Preliminary creation of user documentation. [#22]

- Established changelog [#8]

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Created ``generate_random_data``, to create simulated catalogues for testing
  full end-to-end matches. [#20]

- Implemented computation of match probabilities for islands of sources,
  and secondary parameters such as flux contamination likelihood. [#19]

- Added naive Bayes priors based on the relative local densities of the two
  catalogues. [#18]

- Functionality added to create "island" groupings of sources across the two
  catalogues. [#16]

- Creation of the perturbation aspect of the AUF, in the limit that it is
  unused (i.e., the AUF is assumed to be Gaussian). [#12]

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Correct typing of ``point_ind`` in ``misc_function_fortran``'s
  ``find_nearest_point``. [#18]

- Fix mistake in ``haversine`` formula in ``perturbation_auf_fortran``. [#15]

API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

- Moved ``delta_mag_cut`` from ``make_perturb_aufs`` to an input variable, defined
  in ``create_perturb_auf``. [#19]

- Moved ``find_nearest_auf_point`` from being specific to ``perturbation_auf``,
  now located in ``misc_functions_fortran`` as ``find_nearest_point``. [#18]

- Update ``run_star`` to ``run_source``, avoiding any specific match
  implication. [#16]

- Require ``psf_fwhms`` regardless of whether ``include_perturb_auf`` is yes or
  not. [#9, #10]

- Preliminary API established, with parameters ingested from several
  input files. [#7]
